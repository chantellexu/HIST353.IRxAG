 <em>If you've read my work so far, it's clear that I have a bias...I wrote the following at the beginning of my research, and my bias has come out in my writing even more than I thought it would: </em>
 
 I find myself much more aligned with Ibn Rushd's viewpoints, and my bias continues to increase as I go more into their works and debates. 
<br>
<br>
Having grown up in a Western society like Canada, I am much more familiar with, and have been more impacted by Aristotelian philosophy. My theological beliefs also more easily align with Ibn Rushd, coming from a Christian background.
<br>
<br>
Although I'm trying to stay open-minded, it's important for me to recognize my bias––especially because I feel myself siding with Ibn Rushd on many topics. I acknowledge that my philosophical and theological predispositions come into play in my writing, with my bias most noticeably found (I think) in my critiques of Al-Ghazali.
