 I find myself much more aligned with Ibn Rushd's viewpoints, and my bias continues to increase as I go more into their works and debates. 
<br>
<br>
Having grown up in a Western society like Canada, I am much more familiar with, and have been more impacted by Aristotelian philosophy. My theological beliefs also more easily align with Ibn Rushd, coming from a Christian background.
<br>
<br>
Although I'm trying to stay open-minded, it's important for me to recognize my bias––especially because I feel myself siding with Ibn Rushd on many topics. I acknowledge that my philosophical and theological predispositions come into play in my writing, with my bias most noticeably found (I think) in my critiques of Al-Ghazali.
