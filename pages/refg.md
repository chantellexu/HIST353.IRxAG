 I have found myself much more aligned with Ibn Rushd's viewpoints, and my bias continues to increase as I go more into their works and debates. 
<br>
<br>
Having grown up in a Western society like Canada, I am much more familiar with, and have been more impacted by Aristotelian philosophy. I've also found that my theological beliefs more easily align with Ibn Rushd, coming from a Christian background.
<br>
<br>
While I try to remain open-minded, I recognize my bias, and acknowledge that my greater critique of Al-Ghazali's ideas stems from my philosophical and theological predispositions.
