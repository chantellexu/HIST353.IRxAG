<strong> Historians and Scholars </strong> interested in Islamic philosophy, theology, and history are primary stakeholders––more specifically, those interested in the intellectual and sociopolitical dynamics present in the Islamic Golden Age, particularly concerning the works of Ibn Rushd and Al-Ghazali. 
<br>
<br>
<strong> Religious Institutions and Individuals </strong> interested in Islamic theology and jurisprudence might find this research useful for learning more about the historical development of Islamic thought and its implications for contemporary religious discourse.  Similarly, people interested in <strong> Interfaith Dialogues</strong>, working to promote understanding between different religious and cultural traditions, can use this research to gain insight into how philosophical and theological differences have historically influenced sociopolitical attitudes.
<br>
<br>
<strong> Policy Makers and Political Analysts </strong> involved in governance and policy-making, especially in regions with significant Muslim populations, can find insights into historical perspectives on the relationship between religion and politics relevant to contemporary debates on secularism, governance, and religious freedom. 
<br>
<br>
Members of the <strong> General Public </strong> interested in history, philosophy, religion, and politics may also find interest in this research.
