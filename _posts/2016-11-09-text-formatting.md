<span style="font-size:0.95em;">Ibn Rushd believed in cultural exchange and saw it as a means of intellectual enrichment; he believed that engaging with the works of non-Muslim philosophers could help improve his understanding of the natural world, philosophy, and science. He particularly drew a lot from Aristotle, and emphasised the rational aspects of his teachings. Living in mediaeval Spain, Ibn Rushd faced opposition from conservative religious scholars and suspicion from European circles, but he continued to argue for the compatibility of Greek philosophy with Islamic teachings (Habti). We see in “On the Harmony of Religions and Philosophy” his belief in the universality of logic and the importance of intellectual honesty in discourse, he says, “To master [the study of beings by the intellect] the religious thinker must make a preliminary study of logic, just as the lawyer must study legal reasoning. This is no more heretical in one case than in the other. And logic must be learned from the ancient masters, regardless of the fact that they were not Muslims” (Averroës). Ibn Rushd's belief in the universal applicability of logic and the necessity for rational inquiry in understanding the world, impacted his openness to cultural exchange, and contributed to his willingness to engage with ideas outside of his faith. Ibn Rushd bridged a gap between philosophical inquiry and religious doctrine, and had a nuanced understanding of creation and scientific philosophy that accommodated both reason and revelation. His efforts contributed to an intellectual space of critical thinking and open-mindedness. By embracing Aristotle's rationalism and integrating it with Islamic thought, Ibn Rushd challenged prevailing orthodoxies and (I think) was an icon of cultural exchange. Ibn Rushd's efforts to bridge diverse intellectual traditions laid the groundwork for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between reason and revelation, contributing to socio-political discourse in Spain and beyond during the Abbasid Era.

Al-Ghazali held a more cautious view on cultural exchange, emphasising the preservation of Islamic tradition and values amidst external influences. Al-Ghazali goes into specific topics of philosophical disagreement in "The Incoherence of the Philosophers" and he believed that philosophers like Ibn Rushd had an uncritical adoption of foreign ideas. He says “The heretics in our times have heard the awe-inspiring names of people like Socrates, Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc. They have been deceived by the exaggerations [...] to the effect that the principles they have discovered are unquestionable: that the mathematical, logical, physical and metaphysical sciences developed by them are the most profound. [...] When such stuff was dinned into their ears, and struck a responsive chord in their hearts, the heretics in our times thought that it would be an honour to join the company of great thinkers for which the renunciation of their faith would prepare them.” Al-Ghazali's cautionary tone towards the embrace of external influences reflects his concern for maintaining the integrity and authenticity of Islamic thought amidst the influx of ideas from other cultures. His emphasis on the potential dangers of uncritically adopting foreign philosophies highlights his belief in the need for a discerning approach to cultural exchange, one that prioritizes the preservation of Islamic identity and principles. He also points out the challenges posed by translations of Aristotle's works into Arabic, “As far as the translators of Aristotle’s works into Arabic are concerned, our problem is even more difficult. For the translations themselves have been subjected to interpolation and changes, which have necessitated further commentaries and interpretations. As a result, the translations are as much in dispute among the philosophers as the original works are” (Al-Ghazali).  (Which is so funny, because I am using a translated version of his work). These examples show how Al-Ghazali's belief of the sources and limits of human knowledge impacted his views on cultural exchange, emphasising the need to safeguard Islamic identity in the face of cultural exchange.
