Ibn Rushd saw cultural exchange as a means of intellectual enrichment, and believed that engaging with the works of non-Muslim philosophers could help improve his understanding of the natural world, philosophy, and science (Habti). He particularly drew a lot from Aristotle, and emphasized the rational aspects of his teachings.

Al-Ghazali, on the other hand, was skeptical of Greek philosophy, and more broadly, exchange with non-Muslim cultures (Mohd Noor et al.). He famously wrote the book, “The Incoherence of Philosophers” (Al-Ghazali). Al-Ghazali often pointed out that aspects of Greek philosophy contradicted Islamic beliefs, especially when it came to the nature of God, creation, and the afterlife (Al-Ghazali). He was concerned that “blindly” accepting foreign philosophical ideas could possibly lead Muslims away from their faith. However, in his book “On the Value of Knowledge, Instruction, and Learning together with its evidence in tradition and from reason” he discusses the importance of seeking knowledge (Al-Ghazali).
