Ibn Rushd believed in the importance of reason and rational inquiry alongside religious teachings. In his political philosophy, he advocated for a ruler guided by philosophy and reason. He argued that while religious law (Sharia) is essential for moral guidance, political governance should be based on rational principles rather than religious authority (Omar). He supported the idea of a government led by a philosopher-king, who would rule according to reason and justice. He supported rulers being well-versed in philosophy and capable of ensuring the welfare of the people (Omar). 

Al-Ghazali defended orthodox Sunni beliefs, and emphasized the primacy of religious knowledge. In terms of political governance, Al-Ghazali emphasized the importance of religious law (Sharia) as the basis for governance. He believed that the ruler should be guided by Islamic principles and jurisprudence in governing the state. He saw political rulers as custodians of religious law and moral values, responsible for upholding justice and promoting the welfare of the community according to Islamic teachings (Young et al.).
