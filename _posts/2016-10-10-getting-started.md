<span style="font-size:0.95em;">Ibn Rushd believed in the importance of reason and rational inquiry alongside religious teachings. In his political philosophy, he advocated for a ruler guided by philosophy and reason. He argued that while religious law, Sharia, is essential for moral guidance, political governance should be based on rational principles rather than religious authority (Omar). Ibn Rushd's belief in the autonomy of political authority from religious doctrines can be seen in his political treatise "The Decisive Treatise" where he advocates for a rational approach to governance, discussing the intersection of religion and philosophy, aiming to establish the legitimacy of philosophical inquiry within the framework of Islamic Law. In the treatise he gives the analogy, “The relation between the aim of these people and the aim of the Legislator [can be illustrated by] a parable of a man who goes to a skilful doctor. [This doctor’s] aim is to preserve the health and cure the diseases of all the people, by prescribing for them rules which can be commonly accepted, about the necessity of using the things which will preserve their health and cure their diseases, and avoiding the opposite things. He is unable to make them all doctors, because a doctor is one who knows by demonstrative methods the things which preserve health and cure disease.” Ibn Rushd believed that while religious teachings, like a doctor's prescriptions, are essential for moral guidance and individual well-being, they should not be the sole basis for political governance. He argued for a separation between religious authority, represented by the Legislator, and political authority, suggesting that governance should be guided by rational principles rather than religious doctrine alone. Ibn Rushd advocated for a ruler who is informed by philosophy and reason in political decision-making. He supported rulers being well-versed in philosophy and capable of ensuring the welfare of the people (Omar). Ibn Rushd's stance on the compatibility of reason and religion continues to resonate in contemporary debates on the role of faith in shaping political discourse and policy.

Al-Ghazali defended orthodox Sunni beliefs, and believed in the primacy of religious knowledge. In terms of political governance, Al-Ghazali emphasised the importance of Sharia as the basis for governance. He believed that a ruler should be guided by Islamic principles and jurisprudence in governing the state. He saw political rulers as custodians of religious law and moral values, responsible for upholding justice and promoting the welfare of the community according to Islamic teachings (Young et al.). Al-Ghazali's work "The Revival of the Religious Sciences" underscores his belief in the necessity of religious guidance in political matters, advocating for the implementation of Sharia as the basis for governance. He emphasises that religion must actively engage in addressing worldly issues, asserting that "the real world is an afterlife field" (Al-Ghazali). He argues that religion and the state are inseparable, likening them to "twin sisters," with religion providing guidance and the government ensuring its implementation. Al-Ghazali contends that the government's role is to lead people towards the “good of the Hereafter” while creating a society conducive to spiritual growth. This perspective underscores his view that religion should inform governance to ensure societal well-being and spiritual fulfilment. Al-Ghazali's stance reflects the broader tension between central authority and regional autonomy during his time, as he grappled with the weakening of the Abbasid Caliphate and the rise of regional powers like the Seljuks (Sahri). Al-Ghazali's endorsement of the integration of religion and politics reflected a broader Islamic tradition that prioritized religious principles in governance, emphasizing the significance of Sharia as a guiding framework for societal organization.
