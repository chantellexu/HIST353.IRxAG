Ibn Rushd examined his theological beliefs through the lens of logic and reason, and relied on the Quran as one of his foundations for his philosophy. This is demonstrated well through his explanation of creation. He argues that what is necessary for “common” people to know, will be revealed in a way that is easy to understand, and that because of this, the Law must have used examples of the creation of things in the tangible world (Averroës and Hourani 4). His point becomes more clear as we go further in depth on his argument that creation points to the existence of God. Ibn Rushd draws attention to how elements and features of the earth intricately work together and compliment one another—how all the animals and the plants and of the earth are fit for the habitation of a man, and other animals living in it, how the water is fit for sea animals, and how the air is fit for birds. (Averroës and Hourani 5) In this sort of mic drop moment, Ibn Rushd finishes his point by saying, “if there be anything amiss in this creation and edifice, the whole world would come to confusion and disorder, then [one] would come to know with certainty that it is not possible that this harmony in it [...] be found by chance only.”

If this can’t be seen today! How the imbalances caused by humans in our ecosystems, and ultimately global ecosystem, are leading to a climate crisis—‘climate crisis’ embodying an exorbitant number of climate issues ("Scientists Deliver 'Final Warning' on Climate Crisis" ). Scientists have also recently discovered the extent of fine-tuning of our universe; if the balance between the energy (or mass equivalence) and the universe’s accelerating expansion deviated even slightly, gravitational forces would either excessively constrict the expansion of space…or allow it to expand so rapidly that little of interest would remain (McRae). The universe also exhibits a neutral charge, with nearly identical numbers of protons and electrons, canceling out each other's charges. Any deviation from this balance would result in either a positively or negatively charged Universe, leading to significant consequences such as matter clumping together or pushing itself apart (McRae).

*Ibn Rushd also states, “For when a man sees the sun, the moon, and all the stars, which are the cause of the four seasons; of days and nights, of rain, water and winds.” (Averroës and Hourani 5) This might not sound particularly scientific in accordance with today's standards, but it’s likely founded on an understanding that the Sun’s varying angles relative to the earth’s surface throughout the year was responsible for the seasons. Ibn Rushd may have also been aware of the moon's gravitational pull causing tides in bodies of water, or having at least some effect on the ocean. While stars themselves don't directly cause the seasons, their positions in the sky were often used as markers for seasonal changes.*

Ibn Rushd believed that knowledge could be attained through rational inquiry and philosophical reflection, reconciling Aristotelian philosophy and Islamic thought. He believed that reason, philosophy, and faith worked together. Whereas Al-Ghazali prioritized religious revelation, and believed in spiritual insight as a source of knowledge. He questioned the reliability of human reason. (Although he contradicts himself with this—I only have rough notes right now but will go into it).
