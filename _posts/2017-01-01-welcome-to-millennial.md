## The sources and limits of human knowledge

<u>Sources of human knowledge</u>: Ibn Rushd believed that knowledge could be attained through rational inquiry and philosophical reflection, reconciling Aristotelian philosophy and Islamic thought. Whereas Al-Ghazali prioritized religious revelation, and believed in spiritual insight as a source of knowledge.

<u>The limits of human knowledge</u>: Ibn Rushd believed that reason, philosophy, and faith worked compatibly. Whereas Al-Ghazali questioned the reliability of human reason.

<u>Key topics in their discussions</u>: the integration of philosophy and theology, the role of revelation, the nature of spiritual insight, faith and certainty.
