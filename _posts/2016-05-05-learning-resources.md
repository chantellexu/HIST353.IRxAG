 Ibn Rushd generally approached mysticism with skepticism (rhyme!). He believed that true knowledge of God could be attained through reason and rational inquiry rather than mystical experiences. Ibn Rushd emphasized the importance of philosophy and the intellect in understanding the nature of God and the universe. He saw mysticism as potentially leading to subjective experiences that might not necessarily align with rational truths (Ben Ahmed and Pasnau). 
 
 Al-Ghazali was a mystic, and is often credited with reviving Islamic mysticism (Sufism) in his time (Hasan). He wrote extensively on spirituality and mystical experiences (Al-Ghazali). He placed a significant emphasis on the importance of mystical experiences and inner spiritual journeys as a means of attaining closeness to God. Al-Ghazali's work "The Revival of the Religious Sciences" (Ihya Ulum al-Din) is considered a cornerstone in the development of Islamic mysticism, where he discusses various aspects of Sufism and the inner dimensions of faith. Al-Ghazali believed that while reason was important, true knowledge of God and spiritual fulfillment could only be attained through direct personal experience and inner transformation, which were central to Sufi practices (Al-Ghazali).
